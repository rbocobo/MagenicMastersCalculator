Here's the story of a lovely lady 
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls. 
All of them had hair of gold, like their mother, 
The youngest one in curls. 

Here's the store, of a man named Brady, 
Who was busy with three boys of his own, 
They were four men, living all together, 
Yet they were all alone. 

Till the one day when the lady met this fellow 
And they knew it was much more than a hunch, 
That this group would somehow form a family. 
That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch. 
The Brady Bunch, 

That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch. 
The Brady Bunch.
